Got a favourite cafe and wanna add it to the list?

This is done by geeks and for geeks so you need to use Github.

Eight easy steps using just GitHub web interface:
1. Open project's webpage on Github.  
2. Navigate to __index.md__ file and open it.  
3. Click __Fork and edit this file__ button.  
4. Add a new cafe following markdown formatting you see in a file.  
5. Don't forget a proper commit msg at the bottom.  
6. You will see GitHub Pull request page.  
7. Fill it, press __Send pull request__.  
8. There is no step 8.
